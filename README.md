## Overview

ALX Backend Storage is designed to streamline the development process for ALX projects by providing a standardized structure and set of tools for backend development. It includes modules for handling authentication, database management, file storage, and more, allowing developers to focus on building robust features rather than reinventing the wheel.

## Features

- **Authentication**: Easily integrate authentication mechanisms such as JWT, OAuth, or session-based authentication.
- **Database Management**: Utilize database connectors and ORM libraries for seamless interaction with various database systems.
- **File Storage**: Implement file storage solutions like AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or local file storage with ease.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Integrate logging and monitoring tools for better visibility into application performance and errors.
- **Scalability**: Design scalable architectures using microservices, serverless functions, or containerized applications.
- **Security**: Implement security best practices such as input validation, encryption, and role-based access control.

## Getting Started
