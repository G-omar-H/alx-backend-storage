## Introduction

Welcome to the NoSQL MongoDB project! This project is designed to help you gain a deep understanding of NoSQL databases, particularly MongoDB, and how to work with them using Python. By completing the tasks outlined in this project, you will learn fundamental concepts of NoSQL databases, such as document storage, querying, insertion, updating, and deletion of data.

## Project Overview

This project consists of several tasks, each focusing on a specific aspect of MongoDB and Python integration. From listing databases to performing advanced queries, you will gradually build your proficiency in using MongoDB for various data management tasks.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to:

- Understand the concept of NoSQL databases and MongoDB.
- Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.
- Perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in MongoDB.
- Execute MongoDB commands using both the mongo shell and Python scripts.
- Write Python scripts to interact with MongoDB collections using the PyMongo library.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed:

- MongoDB 4.2
- Python 3.7
- PyMongo 3.10

You can follow the installation instructions provided in the project tasks to set up MongoDB and Python environment.

## Project Structure

The project directory contains the following files and directories:

- **`0x01-NoSQL`**: Main directory for the project tasks.
- **`README.md`**: This file, providing an overview of the project.
- **`mongo_installation_guide.md`**: Guide for installing MongoDB on Ubuntu 18.04.
- **`requirements.txt`**: List of Python dependencies required for the project.
- **Task Files**: Individual files for each task, such as `0-list_databases`, `1-use_or_create_database`, etc.

## Task Completion

Each task is accompanied by a script file (`.sh` for MongoDB commands and `.py` for Python scripts) and a corresponding README entry. Your goal is to complete the tasks as per the requirements mentioned in the READMEs.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `0x01-NoSQL` directory.
3. Read the README file for each task to understand the requirements.
4. Complete the task by writing the necessary MongoDB command or Python script.
5. Test your implementation to ensure it meets the specified criteria.
6. Once you've completed a task, commit your changes and push them to your forked repository.
